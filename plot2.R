#Making Plots

##Our overall goal here is simply to examine how household energy usage varies over a 2-day period in February, 2007. Your task is to reconstruct the following plots below, all of which were constructed using the base plotting system.
##First you will need to fork and clone the following GitHub repository: https://github.com/rdpeng/ExData_Plotting1
##For each plot you should
##Construct the plot and save it to a PNG file with a width of 480 pixels and a height of 480 pixels.
##Name each of the plot files as plot2.png

# Plot 2
# convert data and time to specific format
data$Date <- as.Date(data$Date, format = '%d/%m/%Y')
data$DateTime <- as.POSIXct(paste(data$Date, data$Time))
# open device
if(!file.exists('figures')) dir.create('figures')
png(filename = './figures/plot2.png', width = 480, height = 480, units='px')
# plot figure
Sys.setlocale(category = "LC_ALL", locale = "english")
plot(data$DateTime, data$Global_active_power, xlab = '', ylab = 'Global Active Power (kilowatt)', type = 'l')
# close device
dev.off()
